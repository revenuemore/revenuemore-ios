## Why Choose Swift Package Manager (SPM)?

While both **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** and **CocoaPods** are excellent choices for managing dependencies, **SPM** offers several advantages:

- **Native Integration:** SPM is built into Xcode, eliminating the need for additional tools.
- **Simplified Workflow:** Easier to set up and manage dependencies directly within Xcode.
- **Performance:** Faster dependency resolution and integration.
- **Modern Support:** Actively supported and updated by Apple, ensuring compatibility with the latest Swift features.

For these reasons, we recommend using **Swift Package Manager (SPM)** for integrating **RevenueMore** into your projects.
